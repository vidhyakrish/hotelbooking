This is simply an example to show how Localstorage works and bit of JS and UI work.


Booking (Page 1)

Quite often clients will phone into a restaurant and a customer’s booking need to be captured into 

the system. This should be a simple page that allows a user to capture the details of a diner. The 

diners details might include fields such as:

• First Name

• Last Name

• Dining Date

• Number of Covers (How many people?)

• Phone Number

• Email

for updating the booking page – i have used LocalStorage.

Seating (Page 2)

At the reception desk of a restaurant, the concierge will look at a list of diners and mark them as 

seated. This page should pull in data that you captured in Booking.

The page should allow the concierge to mark a diner at two stages, and might include a simple drop 

down with two values:

• Not arrived

• Seated
